# WeatherVane

A front-end React app that enables users to view works of art that correspond with the weather in their current location. Users can also change their location by either interacting with a MapBox map or entering a new location into a text field. My one rule for myself when building this project was that I could only use functional components with hooks.


## Getting Started

In order to run this application, you'll need to request your own API keys from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api), [Harvard Art Museums](https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api), and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com) and adjust the routes accordingly. Then, clone this repo, run `nmp install`, and then run `npm start`. Ta da!
